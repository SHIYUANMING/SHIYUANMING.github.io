/*“We have not succeeded in answering all our problems. The answers we have found only serve to raise a whole set of new questions. In some ways we feel we are as confused as ever, but we believe we are confused on a higher level and about more important things.”*/ — posted outside the mathematics reading room, Tromsø University

My research focuses on optimization, statistics, computation and communication for network science, data science, and machine learning, including: 

- Mobile AI and intelligent IoT
- Dense communication networks
- Big data processing and analysis
- Deep and reinforcement learning
- Optimization theory and algorithms
- High-dimensional probability and statistics
